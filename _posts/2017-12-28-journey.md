title: The journey...
---
I recently decided to turn all my gym progress into a blog, to serve you as inspiration. It covers gym-routines, nutrition plans, supplementation, before and after, measurements and all sorts of useful things.

If you are a control freak like I am, this will serve you well, and if not, it will still serve you well, because evidence. Alas I will not post at the pace Game of Thrones leak's rate, I intend to publish weekly and offer everything for free. Warning: I do not have any formal education in nutrition, philosophy nor bodybuilding, yet I consumed months worth of content from people I admire. Without further adieu, my journey:

About 6 months ago, I decided to re-join gym as I felt terribly uncomfortable with the extra weight and my lifestyle habits. Yada, yada, yada, 3 books later I became a fan of stoicism and started to slowly implement some of its core values, focusing mostly on discipline. Thus, day one meant to start documenting and plan ahead my progress, from zero to hero, no excuse.

I hope we both agree it would take me a few too many pages to describe every step of my journey in a single post. Hence, I have series of four in the following month. On the plus side, it allows me to produce nice little charts and pdf programmes to help you skim through my gibberish. Yeah, yeah, all free. And don’t worry, it’s just like mid-school all over again. This time with someone eager to explain it to you.

### Progress

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/wight.png)

That diagram is surely curvy. Like I used to be. As promised a before and after
can be found here [instagram - clickbait](https://www.instagram.com/p/BcDf2T9hY84/?taken-by=stoicphysique).
Not a fan of spreading swimsuit pictures all over the
internet, let's behave, shall we ?!
Assuming you took the bait, it took me around 4 months and 1/2 to get somewhere
close to what people call "d*ckskin" body. And man it was steep.

### Briefly, what's up with that graph

#### Briefly, gym routine

I train 6 days a week, always saving Sunday for other things, like writing.
I started easy with 3 times a week, next week I increased it to 4 times, you get the idea.
At some point I ended entering the gym 8-10 times a week (gym-work-gym-sleep).
Alas it didn't make much of a difference, that's when I learnt moderation.
Things worth mentioning for now:

* I don't do cardio, never did, zero, yet here I am.
* I don't skip leg day, in fact I started with leg day.

#### Briefly, nutrition

My calorie regime gradually went from 9999 kcals down to 2000 kcals a day, down to
1500 kcals at peak stupidity. Fancy some fasting here and there?! My macros did
not look great in the beginning, but I had one thing right at least: lots of protein.
Obviously, I didn't know why that was important, but who cared, sempai Athlean-X
said it is important. Other things worth mentioning for now:

* I stopped the insanity at 1500 kcals when I couldn't bench 50kg. Hint: carb depleted.

#### Briefly, supplementation

Like I said earlier, I had one thing right from day 1: protein. Somewhere
in the process -end of August- I started to binge on Creatine and BCAAs.
If you don't know what these are, you should have payed more attention
to your chemistry classes, JESUS! I will cover everything you need to know in subsequent posts.

### Coming next - ordered by importance you should give:

*  The journey - nutrition
*  The journey - training programmes
*  The journey - supplementation

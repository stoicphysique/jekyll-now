title: The journey...
---
I recently decided to turn all my gym progress into a blog, to serve you as inspiration. This includes gym-routines, nutrition plans, supplementation, before and after, measurements and all sorts of useful things.

If you are a control freak like I am, this will serve you well, and if not, it will still serve you well, because evidence. Alas I will not post at the pace Game of Thrones leak's rate, I intend to publish weekly and offer everything for free. Warning: I do not have any formal education in nutrition, philosophy nor bodybuilding, yet I consumed months worth of content from people I admire. Without further adieu, my journey:

About 6 months ago, I decided to re-join gym as I felt terribly uncomfortable with the extra weight and my lifestyle habits. Yada, yada, yada, 3 books later I became a fan of stoicism and started to slowly implement some of its core values, focusing mostly on discipline. Thus, day one meant to start documenting and plan ahead my progress, from zero to hero, no excuse.

I hope we both agree it would take me a few too many pages to describe every step of my journey in a single post. Hence, I have series of four in the following month. On the plus side, it allows me to produce nice little charts and pdf programmes to help you skim through my gibberish. Yeah, yeah, all free. And don’t worry, it’s just like mid-school all over again. This time with someone eager to explain it to you.

### Progress

That diagram is surely curvy. Like I used to be. As promised a before and after
can be found on instagram - not a fan of spreading swimsuit pictures all over the
internet, let's behave, shall we ?!


### Coming next:

There is some natural order in everything surrounding us. Good news:
you can decide that order for yourself. Bad news: here is mine and it will be reflected in the
following posts:

The journey - nutrition

The journey - training programmes

The journey - supplementation
